# wildcat-retail
This repository holds my files for a website that was worked on as a group that our teacher actually suggested we put on our portfolio's. The website was actually really fun to work on and I'm glad that I took that Web Design course.

Also for this project, the video files that we had are actually too large to upload to GitHub so I'm working on figuring that out on how I might be able to get them on, but besides the video everything else should showcase the website just fine.
